SixEye API
##############

Welcome to the API documentation for SixEye.

SixEye combines the management and control of products from multiple manufacturers into one portal, accessible in your web browser.

This API is provided for interaction with the SixEye system, allowing management of Sites, Portals, Users and Devices.

In general, if you are a user of a SixEye system you don't need this API - it is more likely required by administrators of multiple SixEye sites or systems.
