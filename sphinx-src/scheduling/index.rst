The *Scheduling* feature of SixEye allows *Tasks* to be run at user-specified times for a specific *Site*. Using the API you can create *Task Schedulers* which associate a task to be performed with a *Schedule* which defines when the task recurs.

You can use the *Occurrences* API to find out information about what tasks will be run at a particular time or range of times.

TODO: What is a scheduler function??
